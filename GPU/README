# This directory contains a sample Slurm scripts for the use of GPUs on Spartan. The main difference between submitting a standard Slurm job and a job that makes use of GPUs is additional paramters to the Slurm script. A user will need to specifiy that the GPU partition is being used and, in addition, a generic resource (GRES) resource request hhas been specified and the quantity of GPUs being requested.

#SBATCH --partition gpu 
#SBATCH --gres=gpu 

# One can also select instead, if you have access:
#
#SBATCH --partition gpgpu

# For example if you wish to access up four GPUs in a single job use:

#SBATCH --gres=gpu:4.

# However, note that this is for any type of GPGPU. However we have different GPGPUs installed. This will need to be specified.
#
# For example if you submit a job that says `--gres=gpu` for 1 GPU or `--gres=gpu:2` for 2 GPUs per task then that can be satisfied by either type
# but if you need a specific type (say P100) then you need to submit with `--gres=gpu:p100` and if you need 2 per task then you would do `--gres=gpu:p100:2`.

# "GPUs are high bandwidth, high latency. Trying to get the GPU to beat a CPU for a nanosecond job (or even a millisecond or second job) is 
# completely missing the point of doing GPU stuff. Below is some simple code, but to really appreciate the performance benefits of GPU, you'll 
# need a big problem size to amortize the startup costs over... otherwise, it's meaningless. I can beat a Ferrari in a two foot race, simply 
# because it take some time to turn the key, start the engine and push the pedal. That doesn't mean I'm faster than the Ferrari in any 
# meaningful way."
