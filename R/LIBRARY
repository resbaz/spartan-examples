# R's extension are known as libraries. A lot of these have been installed by the Spartan HPC sysadmins when the main package itself is installed. To check what libraries are available, load the R module and enter that environment. Then run the command to display the available libraries.

[lev@spartan R]$ module load R/3.2.1-GCC-4.9.2
[lev@spartan R]$ R
R version 3.2.1 (2015-06-18) -- "World-Famous Astronaut"
..
> installed.packages(lib.loc = NULL, priority = NULL, noCache = FALSE, fields = NULL, subarch = .Platform$r_arch)

# Note that the libraries available will differe for each version of R. If a library that you are looking for is not present, it is worthwhile asking the HPC sysadmins to install it. Send an email to  `hpc-support@unimelb.edu.au`. 

# However, sometimes a local (personal) library is required. Create a directory for local R libraries, invoke R, and install packages to that direcory. For example:

[lev@spartan R]$ mkdir ~/R_libs
[lev@spartan R]$ R
R version 3.2.1 (2015-06-18) -- "World-Famous Astronaut
..
> install.packages("snow", repos="http://cran.r-project.org", lib="~/R_libs/")
..
> q();
[lev@spartan ~]$ echo 'R_LIBS_USER="~/R/libs"' >  $HOME/.Renviron
echo 'R_LIBS_USER="~/R_libs"' >  $HOME/.Renviron
[lev@spartan ~]$ ls ~/R_libs/
snow


# Check to see that the library path has been added correctly.
